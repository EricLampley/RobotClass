# RobotClass
Application that works with multiple "robots" using inheritance to manuever around a set grid according to user input. Works as an uber in a sense. 
I Developed a base Robot class named "Robot101", and a derived robot class named "Robot201" which inherited the existing class properties.
Included are both header files for each robot, implementation files, and a test main program to test the functions created.
